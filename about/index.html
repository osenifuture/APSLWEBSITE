            <h2>Structured Cabling for Power and Data</h2>
            <p>Structure cabling refers to as the organized arrangement of cabling infratsucture within a building or
                campus
                to enable the transmission of data and power.It si often used in office buildings, data centers, and
                other
                large facilities to provide a reliable and efficient communication network.sructured cabling systems
                consist
                of combination of cables,connectors,racks,and other hardware that are designed to support multiple
                devices
                and appilications.they include both fibre-optic and copper cables and typically seperate power and data
                transmission into seperate channels.Power Over Ethernet(PoE)is a technology that allows both data and
                power
                to be transmitted over a single ethernet cable.PoE is commonly used withIP phones, wireless access
                point,
                and security cameras,among other devices.By providing power over the ethernet cable.PoE eliminate the
                needs
                for seperate power cables and simplifies the installation process.Structured cabling system are designed
                to
                support high speed data transmission rates,and can be easily upgraded as technology evolves.they can
                also
                provide a centralized location for managing network connections,making it easier to troubleshoot
                problems
                and implement changes.Overal,structured cabling systems provide a erliable and efficient infrastucture
                for
                transimitting both power and data within a building or campus environment,and essential modern

            <h2>Environment Monitoring System</h2>
            <p>An environment monitoring system is a type of system that is used to monitor and track environmental
                conditions such as temperature,humidity,air quqality, and other factors in a given area.These systems
                commonly used in a variety of settings, including laboratories,data center,hospitals,and other
                facilities
                where maintaining specific environment condition is critical.
                Environment Monitoring Systemtypically consist of sensors that are placed in various locations
                throughout
                the monitored area.These sensors collect data on a variety of environment factors and transmit it to
                acentral monitoring system.the monitoring then analyzes the data and provide alerts or notification if
                any
                environmental conditions fall outside of the established parameters.In addition to monitoring
                environmental
                conditons some systems also provide automated responses to corect any issues that are detected.for
                example.if the temperature in a data center rises above a certain thresold ,the environment monitoring
                system may trigger an alert and activate cooling systems to bring temperature back down to a safe
                level.Environment monitoring systems provides number of benefits,including improved safety,enhanced

            <p>Private Branch Exchange is a telephone systemn used within an organization or business.The purpose of a
                PBX
                is to manage incoming and outgoing phone calls, as well as in ternal communication between employees.A
                traditional PBX system consist of a centralized switching device called PBX,which is connected to
                multiple
                telephone line and extention within the organization.The PBX manage incoming calls and routes them to
                the
                appropriate extensions, as well as providing features such as call forwarding,call holding, an d
                voicemail.Outgoing calls are also routed through the PBX,allowing employees to make external call using
                a
                shared set of phone lines.Modern PBX often use digital technology, such as voice over IP (VoIP),which
